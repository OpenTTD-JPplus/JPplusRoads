RattRoads 1.0.2
------------------------------------

RattRoads provides a complete set of 10 roadtypes (6 normal and [optionally]
4 electrified) plus 2 tramtypes. It has support for American or European 
road styles, climate-aware graphics, plus many parameters for customizing to 
your preferred playstyle.

With this release (1.0) RattRoads is functionally complete, however more 
will be improved on in the future!


WARNING!
===========================================================================

This NewGRF is only compatible with OpenTTD 1.10.0 or later!

----------
Parameters
----------

There are five parameter settings available:

 1) Roadtype Availability - Year-Dependent (Default) || Always Available
  - This setting affects whether roadtypes are introduced depending on year 
(Default) or if they are always available.
 
 2) Difficulty - Normal (Defualt) || Hard || No Speed Limits
  - This affects costs and speed limits. Normal is default costs and speed 
limits, Hard raises costs and lowers speed limits, while No Speed Limits 
uses Normal costs but removes speed limits.

 3) Road Style - American (Default) || European/UK
  - This setting changes the center stripe design which will be displayed, 
switching between American-style yellow stripes or European/UK/Etc. white stripes.

 4) Enable electrified roads - Off (Default) || On
  - If enabled, this option adds electrified versions of 4 roadtypes for use with 
trolleybuses and other catenary-powered road vehicles. These roadtypes require the 
addition of NRT-enabled vehicle sets to be useful, so are disabled by default.

 5) Enable houses alongside highways - Off (Default) || On
  - By default, houses are forbidden from spawning alongside highways which can cause 
towns to disappear if their roads are replaced by highways. It is highly recommended to 
turn this on for multiplayer servers to prevent griefing from malicious or careless players.
