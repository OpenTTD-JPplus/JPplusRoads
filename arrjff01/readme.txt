﻿------------------------------------
Auz Ratt Roads JF Fork 0.1
------------------------------------

This fork provides a complete set of 34 roadtypes (23 normal and 
[optionally] 11 electrified) plus 2 tramtypes. It has support for 
American, European and Australian road styles, climate-aware graphics, 
plus many parameters for customizing to your preferred playstyle.

With this release (0.0.1) this fork is incomplete, however more 
will be improved on in the future!


WARNING!
===========================================================================

This NewGRF is only compatible with OpenTTD 1.10.0 or later!
This is the first GRF experiment by John Franklin. Use at your own risk!

===========================================================================

----------
Parameters
----------

There are six parameter settings available:

 1) Roadtype Availability - Year-Dependent (Default) || Always Available
  - This setting affects whether roadtypes are introduced depending on year 
(Default) or if they are always available.

 2) Speed Units: MPH || KM/H || M/S (Default)
  - This
 
 3) Difficulty - Normal (Defualt) || No Speed Limits
  - This affects costs and speed limits. Normal is default costs and speed 
limits, while No Speed Limits mostly uses Normal costs but removes speed limits.

 4) Road Style - European/Australian (Default) || American
  - This setting changes the center stripe design which will be displayed, 
switching between American-style yellow stripes or European/Auz/Etc. white stripes.

 5) Enable electrified roads - Off (Default) || On
  - If enabled, this option adds electrified versions of 11 roadtypes for use with 
trolleybuses and other catenary-powered road vehicles. These roadtypes require the 
addition of NRT-enabled vehicle sets to be useful, so are disabled by default.

 6) Enable houses alongside roads faster than (including) 90 km/h, "remote" roads 
and industrial roads - Off (Default) || On
  - By default, houses are forbidden from spawning alongside these roads, including 
Tracks, A-Level, Chidao, Highway, Autobahn and all roads originated from Auz Ratt 
Roads Part 3 (Industrial Roads, Single Lanes), which can cause towns to disappear 
if their roads are replaced by these roads. It is highly recommended to turn this 
on for multiplayer servers to prevent griefing from malicious or careless players.
